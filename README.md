## Base idea for project

Billiard rooms (?)

## Project plan

- [ ] learn about customer whishes first using technics from the book Mom test (all features are done here only for my personal blog)
- [ ] build MVP after we have some positive feadback and someone willing to pay for the service (again, might not be this project)
- [ ] understand growth plan and how we can advance here

## Development Plan for Blog

- [ ] setup basic rails project with docker
- [ ] setup omniauth + devise
- [ ] build API and test them via Postman
- [ ] setup frontend side to support it via vue.js (might be a second blog post)
